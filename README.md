Ice breaker portion/ about me:
<br/>
<br/>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on being a long distance cyclist
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning. I love to learn for the sake of learning. I enjoy reading non-fiction just as much as fiction because I enjoy learning. It also helps me to be a better analyst because it exposes me to a variety of information and tools. I am always working on improving my Excel, SQL, and visulization skills. I am also working to improve my python skills. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to get involved with non-profits and health/ medical science related projects. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything wellness related, tips for traveling abroad, and of course Business Intelligence/ Process Improvement. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can DM me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-brown-bia)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a licensed massage therapist.
