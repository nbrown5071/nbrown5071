# Welcome to my Portfolio Projects Page ðŸ‘‹
<br/>
Here you can find my Portfolio Projects which demostrate my skills and proficiency with business analytic tools like SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc. 

### Read the README
Please take the time to view the README files. They contain relevant information for each project; project description, findings, reviewer comments, etc. 


### Ice breaker portion/ about me: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently training to be a long distance cyclist. The hardest part is actually sitting on that seat vs riding. I hope to do a race later this year.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning. I love to learn for the sake of learning. I enjoy reading non-fiction just as much as fiction because I enjoy learning. It also helps me to be a better analyst because it exposes me to a variety of information and tools. I am always working on improving my Excel, SQL, and visulization skills. I am also working to improve my python skills.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to get involved with non-profits and health/ medical science related projects.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything wellness related, tips for traveling abroad, and of course Business Intelligence/ Process Improvement.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can DM me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-brown-bia).


- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a licensed and practicing massage therapist with 10 years of experience. I cut my teeth in Georgia, but I now reside and practice in Chicagoland.
